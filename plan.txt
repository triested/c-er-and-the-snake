Initial plan:

Sam:
1. Sketch code for moving cursor in terminal in order to print over previous game screen at each step.
2. Code for random level generation.
	Levels will consist of these characters:
	# walls
	. floors
	@ player
	x mobs
	H health
	others?


Trieste:
1. Start code for data structure for game.
	Vector of vector of tile objects.
	Tile object is superclass for:
		floors
		walls
		player
		more eventually
		
2. Player control/step function
	Each step player can move or use weapon.
	Player can't walk through walls and other good stuff like that.
